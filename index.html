      <div class="answer" id="a1" role="region" aria-labelledby="q1">
        <p>Advanced airway management aims to secure and maintain a patient’s airway and adequate ventilation when basic measures are insufficient. Indications include failure to protect the airway (reduced consciousness/GCS ≤8), respiratory arrest, severe hypoxia despite oxygen therapy, significant facial/neck trauma, or obstruction. Contraindications vary by technique — for example, supraglottic devices may be less suitable with high aspiration risk. Advantages include reliable oxygenation, aspiration protection with cuffed tubes, and facilitation of controlled ventilation and medication delivery. Disadvantages include the need for high skill, risk of hypoxia or trauma during attempts, and complications such as dental injury, laryngospasm or unrecognised oesophageal intubation. As an AAP you support preparation, monitoring and troubleshooting under the senior clinician’s direction.</p>

      <div class="answer" id="a2" role="region" aria-labelledby="q2">
        <p>IV cannulation enables rapid vascular access for drugs, fluids and blood sampling. Indications include immediate medication delivery, fluid resuscitation, and diagnostics. Contraindications include local infection, burns, lymphoedema, or known thrombosed veins; in some circumstances IO may be preferred. Advantages are controlled, titratable therapy and blood sampling; disadvantages include difficulty when veins have collapsed, and risks of extravasation, phlebitis or infection. As an AAP you typically prepare equipment, select a suitable site, perform the procedure within your local scope or assist a senior clinician, ensure proper securing and labelling, monitor for complications and escalate if access cannot be safely obtained.</p>

      <div class="answer" id="a3" role="region" aria-labelledby="q3">
        <p>IO access gives fast, reliable systemic access through bone marrow when peripheral IV is unobtainable or time-critical. Indications include cardiac arrest, shocked patients with collapsed veins, severe dehydration or when immediate therapy is required. Contraindications include fracture at the insertion site, local infection or previous IO in the same bone; caution is required with certain bone diseases. Advantages are high first-pass success and rapid drug/fluid delivery; disadvantages include pain on infusion, limited dwell time and possible complications like extravasation, compartment syndrome or infection. AAPs generally prepare and assist with IO under senior supervision, then manage and monitor infusions and the limb closely.</p>

        <p>Fluid infusion restores or maintains circulating volume, corrects dehydration and supports tissue perfusion. Indications include hypovolemia from bleeding, sepsis, dehydration and as a carrier for IV drugs. Contraindications/cautions relate to fluid type and comorbidities — avoid rapid large-volume boluses in patients at high risk of fluid overload (heart/renal failure). Advantages: improves preload and perfusion; disadvantages: risk of pulmonary oedema, dilutional coagulopathy with large volumes and electrolyte disturbances. As an AAP you set up infusion equipment, confirm rates with a senior clinician, monitor the patient and cannula site, and escalate for signs of overload, site issues, or adverse reactions.</p>

      <div class="answer" id="a5" role="region" aria-labelledby="q5">
        <p>A senior clinician is the registered practitioner (paramedic/advanced paramedic or equivalent) with overall clinical responsibility during an incident. They assess patients, authorise advanced interventions and take final responsibility for clinical decisions. As an AAP your role is to support and work under the delegation of that clinician: preparing equipment, performing delegated tasks within scope, documenting care and escalating concerns. Understanding delegation, local SOPs and the chain of command ensures safe teamwork and effective patient care in SECAMB practice.</p>

      <div class="answer" id="a6" role="region" aria-labelledby="q6">
        <p>Your responsibilities include preparing airway equipment, positioning the patient, applying monitoring, assisting with ventilation (BVM) and handing instruments to the senior clinician. You confirm placement using capnography and clinical checks, secure the airway, document details, and monitor physiological response. If difficulty occurs you prepare alternative devices and clearly communicate to support the senior clinician. Work strictly within local policy and always escalate if there is concern about patient safety.</p>

        <p>You prepare and, if competent and authorised, perform IV cannulation: confirm indication, obtain consent, choose a site, use aseptic technique to insert the cannula, secure and label it, and document the procedure. You monitor the site and the patient for complications (infiltration, infection), and if cannulation fails after agreed attempts, you escalate to the senior clinician for alternative access such as IO or further attempts as policy permits.</p>

      <div class="answer" id="a8" role="region" aria-labelledby="q8">
        <p>IO insertion is usually performed by the senior clinician; as an AAP you prepare the device and site, help position and stabilise the limb, provide analgesia if in scope, and hand over the correct equipment. Post-insertion you assist with flushing, securing and labelling the IO, set up infusions and closely monitor the limb for swelling or extravasation, escalating immediately for signs of complication.</p>

      <div class="answer" id="a9" role="region" aria-labelledby="q9">
        <p>You prepare and set up fluid infusions per senior clinician instruction: select the correct fluid, prime lines, connect and secure the cannula, calculate or programme infusion rates, and document volumes given. You monitor the patient for response (vitals, perfusion, respiratory status), watch for fluid overload or site complications, and escalate or stop the infusion if adverse signs occur. Clear documentation and handover are essential.</p>

      </button>
      <div class="answer" id="a10" role="region" aria-labelledby="q10">
        <p>Continuous monitoring enables early detection of deterioration and assesses treatment response. Regularly check airway, breathing, circulation, consciousness and oxygenation, and record observations numerically. As the team member most present with the patient you must report changes promptly and clearly to the senior clinician, documenting what changed and when. Timely escalation can prevent harm; poor monitoring or delayed reporting may cause missed interventions and poorer outcomes.</p>
