        <div class="answer">
          Advanced airway management is used when simple measures (head-tilt, jaw-thrust, oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal airways, bag-valve-mask ventilation) are insufficient to maintain oxygenation or protect the airway. Common methods include supraglottic airway devices and endotracheal intubation. For the AAP, the role is supportive: prepare equipment, pre-oxygenate, apply monitoring (pulse oximetry, capnography, ECG, NIBP), and assist the senior clinician. The main benefits are a reliably secured airway and improved ability to ventilate and protect against aspiration. Risks include procedural complications, delays while attempting definitive airway, and physiological responses (tachycardia, hypertension). Good preparation, team coordination, and immediate readiness to use alternative devices (e.g., supraglottic device if intubation fails) reduce harm and improve success.

        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          IV cannulation provides direct access to the circulation for medications, crystalloid fluids and blood sampling — a core prehospital intervention. For an AAP, duties range from equipment preparation to insertion if competence and delegation allow, or assisting a senior clinician. Key practical steps include vein selection, aseptic skin prep, correct cannula selection and secure fixation. Regular patency checks and observation for swelling, redness or loss of flow are essential. In hypovolaemic or shocked patients veins may be collapsed, increasing difficulty; in such cases escalate to a senior clinician early and consider intraosseous access if indicated. Accurate documentation (gauge, site, time, number of attempts) supports later care continuity and governance.

            <li><strong>Contraindications:</strong> Fracture of target bone, previous IO in same bone, local infection/osteomyelitis, some paediatric growth plate concerns.</li>
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Rapid, reliable access with high success rates even in collapsed veins.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Pain on infusion (especially without analgesia), limited dwell time, risk of extravasation and rare compartment syndrome.</li>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> Secure, label and document insertion site, needle size and time of insertion.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          IO access places a specialised needle into the medullary cavity (commonly proximal tibia, humeral head, or distal femur in children) to deliver drugs and fluids into the central circulation. It is indicated when IV attempts have failed or would unduly delay resuscitation. IO provides very rapid access and allows most resuscitation drugs and fluid boluses to be given effectively. As an AAP you will usually prepare the IO kit, help position and stabilise the limb, provide analgesia where permitted, and assist the senior clinician with insertion. After insertion you must flush to confirm patency, secure the device, label it clearly and monitor the limb. Stop infusion and escalate if swelling, increasing pain or compromised distal perfusion suggest extravasation or compartment syndrome.

          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          Fluid infusion is used to restore or maintain intravascular volume and support organ perfusion. In prehospital care, isotonic crystalloids (e.g., 0.9% saline or balanced solutions) are commonly used for initial resuscitation of hypovolaemia or sepsis as per clinical guidance. As an AAP you prepare fluids and giving sets, prime lines and connect them aseptically, set or calculate infusion rates as directed by the senior clinician, and closely monitor the patient for response and adverse effects. Key monitoring parameters include blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygenation, urine output when available, and peripheral perfusion. Escalate immediately if signs of fluid overload (increasing work of breathing, crepitations, falling oxygen saturations) or infusion site problems are observed.

        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          A senior clinician is the individual with overall clinical responsibility and an extended scope of practice for an incident — typically a paramedic, advanced paramedic, specialist paramedic or other registered practitioner with authorisation for advanced skills. They assess the patient’s clinical needs, make decisions about advanced interventions (airway, IO, medication choices), and provide clinical leadership for the crew. For the AAP, the senior clinician is the person to whom you report assessment findings, from whom you take delegated tasks, and to whom you escalate problems or deterioration. Knowing chain of command, local standing orders and when to call for senior input are essential components of safe, effective prehospital care.

        <div class="answer">
          In practice an AAP supports advanced airway management by making the procedure efficient and safe. Responsibilities include preparing and checking all airway devices, positioning the patient for optimal view, pre-oxygenation, and setting up monitoring equipment. During an attempt you will assist the senior clinician by providing bag-valve-mask ventilation, handing tools, suctioning secretions and applying adjuncts as requested. Once the airway is secured you help confirm placement using capnography, chest rise and auscultation, secure the device and ensure continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation. You must document the procedure in detail and be ready to implement contingency plans (e.g., supraglottic device) if intubation is unsuccessful. Clear communication, assertive escalation if problems arise, and adherence to local protocols protect patient safety.

          An AAP’s role in IV cannulation includes preparing the sterile tray, assessing veins and selecting an appropriate site, performing or assisting the insertion if within local competency, and securing and labelling the cannula. Aseptic technique and good ergonomics improve success and reduce complications. After securing the cannula, flush to confirm patency, record gauge, site and time, and monitor for swelling, pain, redness or loss of flow. If access proves difficult after the agreed number of attempts, you must escalate promptly and help prepare for alternative access such as intraosseous. Clear documentation and handover ensures continuity of care and supports clinical governance.

        <div class="answer">
          IO insertion is commonly performed by a senior clinician but the AAP fulfils vital supporting duties. These include preparing a sterile field and the correct needle size, positioning the patient and limb for optimal access, and providing analgesia if within scope and indicated. After the senior clinician inserts the IO needle, flush to confirm patency and secure the device to prevent dislodgement. Label with insertion time and site, and set up infusions or medications as directed. Regular inspection of the limb is necessary to detect extravasation, swelling or compromised perfusion; any of these findings require immediate cessation of infusion and escalation to the senior clinician for assessment and removal.

        <div class="answer">
          When delivering fluid therapy the AAP must ensure the correct fluid is selected and bag integrity confirmed. Prepare the giving set using aseptic technique, prime to remove air, and connect while securing the cannula or IO access. Set or calculate the infusion rate as directed by the senior clinician and document the volume given and time of initiation. Monitor the patient for therapeutic response (improved perfusion, rise in blood pressure) and for complications such as increasing work of breathing, pulmonary oedema, or local extravasation. Report and escalate any adverse signs immediately. Accurate record keeping and clear communication at handover are critical so receiving teams know exactly what fluids were given and why.

          Continuous monitoring — observing airway, breathing, circulation, level of consciousness and oxygenation — is fundamental in prehospital care because patient conditions can change abruptly. Regular, numerical recording (e.g., SpO₂, respiratory rate, blood pressure, heart rate) lets clinicians assess trends and the immediate effect of treatments. For an AAP, being the constant presence at the bedside means you are often first to notice deterioration. Prompt, structured reporting (what changed, when, and the measured values) to the senior clinician enables faster escalation and can be life-saving. Good monitoring practice also ensures accurate handover to receiving teams and supports incident documentation for clinical governance and learning.

        <div class="answer">
          Safeguarding and infection prevention are integral to prehospital practice. Always assess for immediate safeguarding concerns (risk to children, vulnerable adults) and follow local reporting procedures. Infection control measures — including hand hygiene, aseptic technique during cannulation/IO insertion, PPE use and decontamination of equipment — reduce harm. Correct disposal of sharps and contaminated waste protects staff and patients. Thorough documentation is not optional: note the indication, site, device size, insertion time, confirmation methods (e.g., capnography), volumes given and the patient’s physiological response; include verbal handover content and receiving clinician name. Structured handover (SBAR) and clear documentation support continuity, clinical governance and legal accountability.
